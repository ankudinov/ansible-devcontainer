# What is Ansible AVD?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](excalidraw/provisioning-building-blocks.png)

- [AVD](https://avd.arista.com/) stands for Arista Validated Design as it was based on the [EVPN Deployment Guide](https://www.arista.com/custom_data/downloads/?f=/support/download/DesignGuides/EVPN_Deployment_Guide.pdf)
- A very successful community project used to deploy EVPN based Data Center fabrics
  - Over [200 stars on Github](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd) and 79 contributors as of Sep 2023
  - The most active Arista collection on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arista/avd)
- High level workflow:
  - Define abstracted group/host vars using AVD data model
  - Generate low level device specific variables (aka structured configs)
  - Parse templates, build plain text configs
  - Deliver configs to network devices using Ansible `arista.eos.eos_config`

# Running Ansible in a Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right w:400 contrast:80% drop-shadow:0,5px,10px,rgba(0,0,0,.4)](img/01-primary-blue-docker-logo.png)

- The old story of "it works on my machine":
  - Different versions of Python and Ansible
  - Dependencies
  - Interpreter path issues
  - The famous very-very-very-**VERY** verbose only to find out that:
    `The error appears to be, but may be elsewhere` (c) Ansible üòÖ
  
    > The error handling and input validation is a very significant part of the `ansible.avd` collection.

- Containers help to solve the issues above. But bring new challenges and not always easy to build and use.

# What It Takes to Build a Good Container?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 18px;}</style>

![bg right fit drop-shadow:0,5px,10px,rgba(0,0,0,.4)](img/docker-run.png)

- Craft a Dockerfile with some essentials.
- Add a non-root user, as root breaks permissions, breaks Ansible and ruins your work-life balance üòé.
- Match user ID inside and outside of the container. Some operating systems like RHEL and the family are very strict about it. This is not a trivial task.
- Create an entrypoint.
- Take care of transferring Git credentials, keys, etc. into the container (if it's interactive).
- Think about security and maintaining the container repository.
- ... and it has to be multi-platform: amd64 and arm64 as a minimum.

And now convince someone to run it. :ninja: ‚û°Ô∏è

# Dev Container - A Better Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

![bg right fit](drawio/devcontainer-definition.png)

- [A Dev Container](https://containers.dev) is a container used as a fully featured development environment. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud, in a variety of [supporting tools and editors](https://containers.dev/supporting).
- [Dev Container Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec) was started by Microsoft and has strong community support.
- Dev Containers are powered by:
  - [Prebuilt images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images)
  - [Features](https://containers.dev/features)
